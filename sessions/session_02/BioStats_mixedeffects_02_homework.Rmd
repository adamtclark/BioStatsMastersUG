## Homework problem:

Try analysing the following dataset using the `lme` function.

```{r echo=TRUE}
bdat = read.csv("dataset_1.csv")
n_blocks = length(unique(bdat$block))

# plot
par(mar=c(4,4,2,2))
plot(biomass~diversity, col = rainbow(n_blocks)[bdat$block], data = bdat)
```

What form of regression should you use? Random slopes? Random intercepts? Something else?
  
What do the results of the regression show us? What are the fixed and random effects estimates? What is the variability across parameters?
